# Text Summarizer

The **Text Summarizer** is a Python-based application designed to summarize large pieces of text using OpenAI's language models. It provides a Streamlit-based user interface for easy interaction and allows users to tweak summarization parameters such as maximum summary tokens, chunk size, and chunk overlap.
